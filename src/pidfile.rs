//! `SIGHUP` re-reads the config (see [`crate::signals`]), and the point of that is being able to
//! change the icon size or the item order without restarting the tray -- which needs a
//! pid, and a sibling process cannot read one from the environment. So it goes in a well-known
//! file under the per-user runtime directory, the same arrangement `wlrix-compositor` and
//! `wlrix-idle` use, and the one `wlrix-settings-daemon` looks for.
//!
//! The file is removed on a clean exit via the returned [`Guard`]. A crash leaves it stale; a
//! reader should treat "no such process" as "not running" rather than trusting the file blindly,
//! the way `wlrix-settings-daemon` does.
